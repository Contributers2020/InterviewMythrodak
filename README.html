So that is my end of questions! Your answers were very deep and thoughtful and interesting! Thanks a lot for giving your highly valuable time to me. Have a good day!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">do what you enjoy.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">My thirteenth and the last question is what advice would you give to the aspiring YouTubers out there?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">um for me it&#x27;s just being able to do what i want for a living,  and being able to express my artistic intent freely i suppose</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">That is a great problem that should be solved! My twelfth question is what do you think is the best part of being a YouTuber is?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">oh most definitely change the copyright issues. copyright claims are given free reign of youtube and even if they&#x27;re false or invalid they can still take a content creator&#x27;s money and youtube won&#x27;t do a thing about it. i understand youtube doesn&#x27;t want to get their hands messy in any legal mess, but this screws over so many creators by either a greedy studio wanting to make more cash or just some random guy posing as a studio wanting to make cash. i&#x27;d definitely give the creators a lot more power when it comes to this, or just remove copyright claims altogether, and if someone wanted a video taken down they could do the old fashioned way of asking.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Yeah! My eleventh question is if you were given power to change something on YouTube, what would you do?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">i&#x27;d probably be a musician of some sort or try to make my way into the filmmaker scene, i really like cinematography and music, i&#x27;ve used them a lot in my videos haha</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Ohh! My tenth question is what would you possibly be doing if you didn&#x27;t do YouTube?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">yeah there&#x27;s a few, a big one was in like late 2020 - early 2021 i didnt have stable enough access to the internet to be able to upload videos, or even play on minecraft servers. so i would have to make videos by myself in a singleplayer world, and then drive to a nearby coffee shop for the wifi and upload it there. there&#x27;s another big one that&#x27;s personal that i might expose later down the line but for now it&#x27;s being kept private for now</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Wow! My ninth question is that have you ever had any setbacks in your career and if so, what was it?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">yeah definetly markiplier and technoblade. technoblade&#x27;s the one who got me into pvp and inspired my to start my channel</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Ohh! My eight question is that is there some person or a YouTuber who is an inspiration to you?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">some of them, most of my family is a bunch of backwoods americans who don&#x27;t really know that much about the internet, but those who do don&#x27;t think much of it i suppose</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Ohh! My seventh question is do your family-members watch your videos? If yes, what is their reaction when they do so?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">honestly, i think my favorite thing to do is just to play minecraft, i really love this game, especially pvping in it. i spend most of my time pvping and practicing, but sometimes ill embroider in my free time, i love that as well</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">That is interesting! My sixth question is a bit personal, but, when you‚Äôre not working on a YouTube video, what do you love to do the most?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">yeah people always ask about my name haha, but the real truth behind it is that i stole it from the wickedest gun-slinging rootin-tootin bottle-shootin black-toothed one-legged cowboy in the west once i had defeated him in a 1v1 to the death where our only weapon was porcupine quills :)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Okay! My fifth question is where did you get the name ‚ÄúMythrodak‚Äù from? Is there any story behind it?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">yeah i think people are justified to be discontent with my rate of content. i am most defiantly pushing for a better upload schedule but recently i&#x27;ve been prioritizing quality over quantity and i just want to make enjoyable videos, (plus there&#x27;s been personal complications that have delayed videos longer as well) but nobody really sees behind the scenes, they just see a blank subscription box for 3 months, so i&#x27;d say they&#x27;re justified.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Oh! My fourth question is that you are criticized for your upload schedule. Recently, you have posted a community post and there are comments like &quot;I wonder what this means... Oh well, I&#x27;ll just wait until 2024 to find out!&quot;. Do you think these people are justified and you would want to push yourself for a nice upload schedule or not?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">i definitely didn&#x27;t expect this many this quickly. but i have studied the youtube algorithm so it wasn&#x27;t really a shock to me once my videos gained traction. and i suppose im not really a good judgement of if it&#x27;s worthful üòÖ  so idk</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Wow! My third question is did you ever think you would have as many subscribers as you do now? Do you consider your achievement is worthful for what you have did till now?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">usually it will always be my latest video, because i push myself to my limit to try and make the best content i can. and i always make sure my newest video is better then any others before it, so right now i&#x27;d say the gladiator pit is my best one.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Ohh! My second question is do you have a favorite video you created like you feel personally oh yes this one was the best? If yes, which one?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">well i remember first watching minecraft building tutorials as my first youtube videos i watched, i remember one of the oldest and first youtubers i watched was Madnes64, who did medieval minecraft building tutorials and such, i would always watch these, even though i didn&#x27;t own minecraft. but after that it was kinda a downward spiral into minecraft youtube haha</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Okay! So my first question is how and when did you discover YouTube? Any specific YouTuber you know you first watched?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Yeah fire away :3</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">So ye, can I start with the questions?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff0000">Mythrodak#1111</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Ayup</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">&lt;@!329317214031446016&gt; you there?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#1902</p><p class="time">2022-03-15</p> <p class="message">Hey &lt;@!329317214031446016&gt;.
